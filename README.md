# Ensemble Square

Tools and utilities for Ensemble Stars!! players.

## How to set up locally
1. In the root directory of the project, run `yarn install` in the terminal. This will add all of the necessary packages to your instance of the project.
2. Set the `NODE_ENV` variable.  
Input the following in the terminal depending on your OS:  
Linux and Mac: `export NODE_ENV=development yarn run dev`  
Windows: `$env:NODE_ENV = 'development yarn run dev'`  
Then, input `echo $NODE_DEV`. If done correctly, the terminal should return `development`.
3. Run `yarn run dev`. If everything is working correctly, you should be greeted with Ukki's wonderful face!

If new volunteers have any questions, message us on Discord! This README will be updated as development continues.
